        <strong>Objective of the Training Programme.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        The Agriculture sector in Uganda employs approximately 70% of Uganda’s
        population with almost 80% under subsistence farming characterized by
        limited value addition and low farm productivity. The dairy industry has
        been identified by H.E President Yoweri Museveni under the “four-acre
        model” as one of the main undertakings to uplift and transform
        smallholder farming into commercial agriculture. Under the “four-acre
        model” initiative, the President advised the first acre is used to grow
        cash crops such as coffee and tea, the second for growing fruits, the
        third is for pasture for dairy cows and the fourth is set aside for food
        security at the household level.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, these smallholder dairy farmers are still faced with many
        challenges among them include; inadequate extension advisory services,
        limited practical knowledge on&nbsp;raising dairy animals and disease
        control. The value addition in the dairy industry in Uganda is so low
        with up to 67% consumed as raw milk.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through the above training, Tomosi’s Farm Bweshaire, a model commercial
        dairy enterprise in Uganda seeks to provide practical interventions
        aimed at improving smallholder and commercial dairy farm productivity by
        providing practical skills and knowledge on animal nutrition, breeding,
        records management and young stock management. The target participants
        for the training include; dairy farmers, extension service providers in
        the dairy sector, students, and all relevant stakeholders in the
        Agriculture sector.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          Session One: Introduction to Dairy farming as an enterprise.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Milk production increased to 2.81 billion litres in the period ended
        July 2021 from 2.6bn litres in July, 2020 according to statistics from
        the Dairy Development Authority (DDA). However, the increase was lower
        than three billion litres that DDA had projected during the period.
      </p>

      <p>
        On average only 30 percent of the total annual production is processed,
        which means that there is a lot of wastage and low levels of value
        addition.&nbsp;Milk consumption in Uganda remains low with a per capita
        consumption standing at&nbsp;62 litres per person against World Health
        Organization recommended consumption of&nbsp;200litres. However,
        consumption, according to DDA is expected to slightly increase
        to&nbsp;approximately 65 litres in the short term due to rapid
        urbanisation and other&nbsp;consumption campaigns such as the School
        Milk Programme. The Dairy Sector is one of the leading agricultural
        commodity export income earner to coffee and slowly edging its way to be
        the leading agricultural export earner in the country. For example, the
        sector is growing at an average rate of 8% per annum, contributing to
        export revenues of Ugx 750bn in 2020.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        This session draws participants to appreciate the benefits of
        undertaking dairy farming&nbsp;as an enterprise, its impact on incomes
        for the small households to commercial&nbsp;production levels and the
        opportunities available for the dairy products along the
        value&nbsp;chain
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Session 2: Feeding and nutrition</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Owing to the effects of climate change, the country is experiencing more
        prolonged dry spells thus affecting a majority of dairy farmers, who
        rely on pasture as the main composition of the dairy feeds.
        Unfortunately, some of these farmers lose cattle in addition to the
        significant reduction in milk production. For example, Mr. David Agweno,
        a cattle keeper in Obalia village, Ibuje sub-county in Apac District,
        says his cattle have started dying due to inadequate water and pasture.
        “I have more than 200 head of cattle in my kraal, but I lost more than
        10 calves and I believe it happened due to poor feeding”.
      </p>

      <p>
        What is the volume of feeds a cow should consume in a day? How much
        nutrients must be in a cow’s feeds and what is the required water
        in-take? etc.
        <br />
        Feed and nutrition management is the process of understanding the
        nutrient requirements of dairy cattle at different growth and lactation
        stage and combining&nbsp;various feed ingredients to meet these needs in
        a cost effective manner.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>The objectives of this session are;</strong>
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Understanding the feed and nutritional requirements for maintaining
            dairy cattle in good condition.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Maximizing milk production potential for dairy cattle.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Fulfilling feeds and nutrient requirements of dairy cattle in a
            cost- effective way.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        <strong>Session 3: Young Stock Management</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        This session will provide practical skills and knowledge to the
        participants on how to:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Rear sufficient stock to replaced culled dairy cows.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Lower average age at first calving.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Reduce/ eradicate mortality rate of calves.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The foundation of dairy farming and performance are hinged on how well
        the heifers are handled at a farm. The purpose of rearing young stock is
        to raise well- developed heifers, able to calve at an early age, without
        calving difficulties. The advantages of calving at an early age are;
        lower rearing costs, early productivity and consequently a higher
        life-time milk production, thus making the cows more profitable.
        <br />
        Young stock management begins before birth, a few days before the calf
        is born, the pregnant cow is transferred to a maternity paddock, which
        should be near the homestead to allow closer observation and monitoring.
        At birth and immediately after, the farmer needs to exercise the right
        precautions to ensure that the calf is not lost. Lastly, the feeding
        program for the “heifer calf” should address overall animal health,
        nutrient requirements and rumen development.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Session 4: Artificial Insemination</strong>
        <br />
        The goal for most dairy farmers is to raise cows that are productive,
        efficient and profitable. This can easily be achieved through Artificial
        Insemination (AI) done correctly and with precision. “<br />
        Though AI is common in the cattle industry and often performed by farm
        managers or employees, it should not be assumed that AI is an easy
        technique or that all of those performing AI are proficient in the
        technique. Success rates differ, as can sometimes be evidenced by a
        difference in conception rates between technicians”
        <br />
        At Tomosi’s farm, we understand the objective of farmers and
        practitioners/technicians of AI in the industry because we are farmers
        and we have learned over the years, the best practices through raising
        dairy cattle for optimum production. Our hands-on staff will take the
        learners through the core steps for successful AI among which include;
        reproductive anatomy, sanitation and accuracy of semen deposition.
